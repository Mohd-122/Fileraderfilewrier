I learned a lesson from your lecture. 
I am not good at time management. 

I will try to find my lost times and utilize them from now on.
"time is a choice" I agree with this idea.Also,I think efficiency is also very important. 
When you study or work,it's important to focu on it. 
When you play or relax,remember to enjoy it!

This video has learned me a lot
This video has definitely changed my vision.




I like the idea "I donÂ´t have time" = "It is not a priority",but, sometimes, we take it a priority just because it is urgent to deal with, like if you don't fix the basement which is full of water, it will gets mess. 
I think my real problem is, how to take action on REAL PRIORITY THINGS, not just URGENT THINGS. Anyway, at least, it lead me to think about my priority. Thanks. 
There is a good sentence: Don't manage your time, manage your focus, or manage your priority.
I think Laura's presentation is totally reasonable, useful and important.The reason we don't have time to do something is actually because it's not the top priority in our mind.And we should learn to schedule our time more smartly for those things which truly matter to us.
